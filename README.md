# Hi, I’m Annie 👋  
### Full-Stack TypeScript Engineer  
Design Systems • Typed APIs • Retrieval-Augmented AI  

I build modular systems that pair scalable frontend architecture with well-structured backend services.

🔭 Currently building: Enterprise Trust Center prototype (React + Stencil + GraphQL)

🧠 Exploring: RAG pipelines and provider-agnostic LLM orchestration 

Interested in clean architecture, scalable UI primitives, and pragmatic AI tooling.

Outside of code: bouldering, strategy games, and hiking through National Forests.
